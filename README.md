# Blog-App

Hello, World. 

Getting through the Back-End JavaScript curriculum, I began to miss working on Front-End and was inspired by a friend who regularly kept a blog for years. The functionality is pretty simple and straight forward, as it was more of a practice to shake some rust off. The application starts off with dummy data in the form of two blog posts. The app also has a navigation, feed, login, and registration form. The styling is simple and the colors are absolutely not easy on the eyes. They were more to isolate than to look like a production level code base.

Hope you enjoy!
